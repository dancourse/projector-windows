**Title:** I built a free projector window tool for D&D atmosphere - would love your feedback

**Body:**
```
Hey DMs!

I created Projector Windows (https://projector-windows.netlify.app) as a free tool for adding atmospheric projector displays to D&D sessions - think crackling fireplaces, tavern windows, dungeon corridors, etc.

I'm exploring adding premium features specifically for tabletop gaming (playlist builders, grid overlays, battle sequence automation) and would love input from the D&D community on what would actually be useful.

If you have 5 minutes, I'd really appreciate your feedback: https://projector-windows.netlify.app/survey.html

Thanks for helping shape this tool!

I built a simple tool for creating cozy projector window displays (fireplaces, rainy windows, snowy cabins, etc.) and I'm looking for feedback from people who actually use this kind of thing.

Check it out: https://projector-windows.netlify.app

**Title:** Survey: What premium features would you pay for?

**Body:**

Hey everyone!

First off, thank you for the stars and support. Projector Windows will always have a free tier, but I'm exploring premium features to make the project sustainable.

Before I build anything, I want to hear from actual users about:
- What features would genuinely add value for you
- What pricing model makes sense
- What content you'd be interested in

Please take 5 minutes to fill out this survey: https://projector-windows.netlify.app/survey.html

Your feedback will directly determine what gets prioritized. I'll share the results here once I have enough responses.

Thanks!

Hey everyone! 👋

I built a free projector window tool that some DMs have been using for atmospheric displays (fireplaces, windows, dungeon corridors, etc.) during sessions.

I'm thinking about adding premium features specifically for tabletop gaming - things like:
• Custom playlist builders
• Grid overlays
• Battle sequence automation
• Offline mode

Before I build anything, I'd love feedback from actual DMs on what would be most useful.

5-minute survey: https://projector-windows.netlify.app/survey.html

The tool itself is free to use: https://projector-windows.netlify.app

Thanks for any input you can provide!

## Response Goal

Aim for **50-100 responses** before making major decisions. This gives you:
- Statistical significance for feature prioritization
- Reliable pricing data
- Clear user segmentation (D&D vs. ambiance vs. work)
- Validation before building

---

## Timeline

**Week 1:** Share survey everywhere, aim for 50+ responses
**Week 2:** Analyze data, identify top 3 features
**Week 3:** Create landing page for #1 feature, test pricing
**Week 4:** Begin MVP development

---

## Tracking

Use UTM parameters to track which channels drive the most responses:

- Reddit: `?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=survey`
- Twitter: `?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=tweet&utm_campaign=survey`
- TikTok: `?utm_source=tiktok&utm_medium=bio&utm_campaign=survey`
- GitHub: `?utm_source=github&utm_medium=discussion&utm_campaign=survey`

This helps you understand where your engaged users are coming from.
