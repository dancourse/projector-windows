## Key Talking Points (All Templates)

### Value Propositions
- **For Users**: Eliminates frustration of manual window repositioning when connecting/disconnecting projectors
- **For Brands**: Increases satisfaction and reduces support burden for Mac users
- **For Partnership**: Complementary software creates ecosystem lock-in without competing

### Use Case Examples
1. **Presentation Mode**: One-click switch to optimized layout for slides + speaker notes + video
2. **Movie Night**: Saved configuration for full-screen video on projector, controls on laptop screen
3. **Gaming Setup**: Optimized window placement for gaming on projector with secondary displays for chat/streams
4. **Teaching/Training**: Quick profile switching between lecture, demo, and collaboration modes

### Objection Handling

**"Why not just use macOS built-in display settings?"**
→ Built-in settings don't save window positions, require multiple steps, and don't handle dynamic scenarios well. Projector Windows provides instant recall of complete layouts.

**"Our customers don't report this as a problem."**
→ It's a silent frustration point—users adapt to manual repositioning rather than reporting it. Reducing friction increases satisfaction and brand loyalty.

**"How is this different from other window management tools?"**
→ Projector Windows is specifically designed for projector workflows with display-aware presets, not just general tiling. It understands the difference between built-in displays and projection scenarios.

### Call to Action
- **Affiliate Programs**: "I'd like to apply and start promoting [Brand] immediately."
- **Business Partnerships**: "Can we schedule a 15-minute call to explore this further?"
- **Enterprise**: "I'd appreciate guidance on the best path within your partner program."
