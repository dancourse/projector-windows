### For XGIMI Partnership Inquiry

```
Subject: Partnership Inquiry: Projector Windows + XGIMI Projectors

Hi XGIMI Affiliate Team,

I'm reaching out to explore a partnership between XGIMI and Projector Windows, a macOS utility that enhances the projector experience for your customers.

What is Projector Windows?
Projector Windows is a macOS app that solves window management pain points for projector users - helping them quickly save and restore optimized layouts for presentations, movies, and gaming on XGIMI projectors.

Partnership Approach:
I'd like to join your affiliate program and promote XGIMI projectors to Projector Windows users. In return, I can:
- Feature XGIMI as a recommended brand in the app
- Create integration guides for Projector Windows + XGIMI setup
- Develop content showcasing optimal configurations for XGIMI models

Your customers get better software support, and XGIMI gains visibility among Mac users actively using projectors.

I'd love to:
1. Apply to your affiliate program immediately
2. Explore deeper partnership opportunities (technical integration, co-marketing)

Looking forward to working together.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Projector Windows
[Contact Info]
