**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity: Projector Windows + [BRAND]

Hi [Contact Name / Team],

I'm reaching out to explore an affiliate partnership between [BRAND] and Projector Windows, a dedicated content platform focused on helping consumers choose the right projector.

**About Projector Windows:**

We create in-depth buying guides, projector comparisons, and educational content specifically for the projector market. Our audience is actively researching projector purchases and looking for trusted recommendations.

Current focus areas:
- Home theater projector comparisons
- Portable/smart projector guides
- Gaming projector recommendations
- Projector setup and optimization tutorials

**Why Partner with Us:**

- **Targeted Audience**: 100% projector-focused content (not general tech)
- **Purchase Intent**: Readers are in active buying mode
- **Quality Content**: Detailed reviews and comparisons, not thin affiliate content
- **Long-term Value**: Building comprehensive projector resource hub

**What We're Looking For:**

We'd love to join [BRAND]'s affiliate program to feature your projectors in our buying guides and comparison articles. We're committed to honest, thorough reviews that help readers make informed decisions.

**Next Steps:**

Could you share details about [BRAND]'s affiliate program, including:
- Commission structure
- Application process
- Available marketing materials
- Any content guidelines or requirements

I'm happy to provide more information about our platform, traffic metrics, or content strategy.

Looking forward to exploring this partnership.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
